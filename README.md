# Flight Delay Insurance Smart Contract

## Introduction

This is a simple Flight Delay Insurance smart contract written in Solidity for Ethereum. The contract allows users to purchase insurance policies against flight delays and receive automatic payouts if their flights are delayed beyond a specified threshold.

**Disclaimer:** This is a simplified example for educational purposes and should not be used for real-world insurance without proper development, security audits, and legal compliance.

## Features

- Policyholders can purchase insurance policies by paying a specified premium.
- If a flight is delayed beyond a set threshold, policyholders receive automatic payouts.
- Policyholders can submit claims after a waiting period.
- The contract owner can trigger checks for flight delays.

## Getting Started

To use this smart contract, follow these steps:

1. Deploy the smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.

2. Set the contract parameters, including the premium amount, payout amount, delay threshold, and coverage duration.

3. Users can purchase insurance policies by sending the specified premium amount to the contract.

4. The contract owner can trigger flight delay checks by calling the `checkFlightDelay` function.

5. If a flight delay exceeds the threshold, eligible policyholders will receive automatic payouts.

6. Policyholders can submit claims after a waiting period by calling the `submitClaim` function.

7. The contract owner can withdraw unclaimed policy amounts by calling the `withdrawUnclaimedPolicies` function after the coverage period ends.

## Smart Contract Functions

- `purchasePolicy()`: Allows users to purchase insurance policies by sending the specified premium amount.

- `checkFlightDelay(uint256 delayMinutes)`: Allows the contract owner to trigger flight delay checks and determine if policyholders are eligible for payouts.

- `submitClaim()`: Allows policyholders to submit claims after a waiting period, receiving payouts if eligible.

- `withdrawUnclaimedPolicies()`: Allows the contract owner to withdraw unclaimed policy amounts after the coverage period ends.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure that the contract owner is a trusted entity, as they have control over key functions.

- Consider integrating with real-time flight delay data sources to accurately determine delays.

- Perform thorough security audits and testing before deploying the contract in a production environment.

## Legal and Regulatory Compliance

- Consult legal experts to ensure compliance with local insurance regulations.

- Obtain any necessary licenses or approvals before offering insurance services.
